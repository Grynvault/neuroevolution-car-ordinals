## Introduction

The **Ordinal Neuroevolution Car Project** is an innovative experiment combining **AI, Genetic Algorithm, Gamification, and Ordinals**. The goal is to create an evolving AI-controlled race car that improves its performance through **Neural Networks** and **Genetic Algorithms**, while leveraging **Ordinals** to inscribe the car‚Äôs brain and track its progress over multiple simulations.

The **neural network is built with TensorFlow** and has been inscribed on Ordinals inscription ID **b20f5cb914e8f94dd393c9fa074fbb168eaa464ff24205493c022959f256e3c8i0**.

## Key Components:

- **AI**: The agent (race car) learns and improves over simulations.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Multiple cars learn simultaneously, and the best-performing car's genetic information is passed on to the next generation, accelerating the learning process.
- **Gamification**: The simulation presents challenges requiring adaptation.
- **Ordinals**: The trained neural network is inscribed as a child ordinal, ensuring continuity and progress.

## How It Works

### Race Track and Car Behavior

- The race track starts with a wider gap, allowing easier movement.
- As levels progress, the track becomes narrower, making navigation more difficult.
- The race track layout changes randomly every simulation.
- The car dies (simulation resets) when it hits the wall.

**![Level 19 Racing Track](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grynvault/neuroevolution-car-ordinals/refs/heads/main/images/level-19.png)**

### AI Learning Process

#### Neural Network & Genetic Algorithm

- The car uses a **Neural Network** to determine steering direction.
- A **Genetic Algorithm** evolves better-performing networks over multiple simulations, based on it's parent (previous simulation) genetic information (neural network).

#### Simulation Progression & Ordinal Inscription

- The simulation runs multiple times, allowing the car to **gradually improve**.
- When significant improvement is observed, the **brain (trained neural network) is saved by users**.
- The saved brain is inscribed as a **child ordinal** of the initial simulation.
- Each new brain inscription **updates the parent simulation**, ensuring the latest and most improved model is inherited.

## Comparison with PizzaPets

The **Ordinal Neuroevolution Car Project** draws inspiration from **PizzaPets**, a gamified system where users must continuously feed their pets to keep them alive, with value derived from the commitment to interacting with the system daily. In this project:

- Instead of **feeding a pet**, users **run simulations** to improve the car‚Äôs AI.
- The commitment comes from **using the user's computer to train the car‚Äôs neural network** and **inscribing it**, ensuring progress is preserved and built upon.
- Similar to PizzaPets, where a **neglected pet dies**, an **untrained AI struggles to survive** on increasingly difficult tracks.
- The value of the project lies in the **continuous evolution and improvement of AI**, much like maintaining and nurturing a digital pet in PizzaPets.

## Gameplay and Simulation

- The user watches as the **AI-controlled race car** attempts to complete the track.
- Over time, as new brains are inscribed, the **car should be able to navigate increasingly difficult tracks**.
- The challenge lies in **training an AI model capable of learning and adapting** to various race track configurations.

## Expanding to Other Games and Simulations

This approach can be **adapted to other AI-driven games**, such as:

- Obstacle-based **mazes**.
- **AI-powered NPC behavior** in complex game environments.
- **Inscription-based AI progression** in different learning applications.

## Phase 2 Roadmap

Looking ahead, Phase 2 will introduce more features and enhancements:

- üì± **Create an app** that allows users to train and inscribe the brain directly to the ordinal as a child inscription (similar to the PizzaPets app).
- üèéÔ∏è **Experiment with different track types**, including traditional racing tracks and maze-like obstacle courses.
- üèÜ **Introduce racing competitions**, where users can race their trained car ordinals against others. Cars will be ranked based on performance, with higher-ranked cars demonstrating better AI evolution and increased ordinal value.

üí° **Let us know what you think!** We invite feedback and ideas from the community to shape Phase 2. Your insights and suggestions will help drive the next stage of AI inscription evolution!

## Community Involvement

We highly highly welcome **the Ordinals community** to get involved in shaping the future of AI inscription and gamified AI evolution! Whether by training models, contributing ideas, or sharing insights, **your participation can help drive innovation**.

## Conclusion

The **Ordinal Neuroevolution Car Project** demonstrates how **Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Ordinals** can be integrated to create an evolving AI system. As the AI model improves and **new inscriptions** are made, the **community** can collectively witness and contribute to the **development of a smarter AI race car**.

The potential of this project extends **beyond racing simulations**, offering **new possibilities for AI evolution tracking** and **inscription-based AI progression** in various domains.
